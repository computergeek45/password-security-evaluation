## Tips & Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

- Use **12‚Äì16+ characters** minimum.
- Mix **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**.
- Avoid common dictionary words and personal info.
- Use **passphrases** for both memorability and strength (e.g., `MyDog$eatsRice99!`).
- Don‚Äôt reuse passwords across platforms.
- Use **password managers** to store and generate secure passwords.

## Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type         | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**     | Tries all possible character combinations until it cracks the password.     |
| **Dictionary Attack**| Uses a list of common words and combinations to guess passwords.           |
